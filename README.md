# polymer-playground
This repository is an experiement to test the library **@polymer/lit-element** creating a clasic **todo list**


### The main idea with this repository is understand the folowing:
* Understand the lit-element one way data binding
* How custom and native events work and how to create them
* How I can use system for the CSS styles that can be reused. (I am testing a solution using SCSS and mixins to reuse code, ideas are welcome).
* Integration with webpack and typescript.
* Testing with mocha/chai (Even though polymer propouse a diferent aproach I didn't like it, so I tried a more common one, ideas as well are welcome).

## How to install it
* **yarn** (install dependencies)
* **yarn start** (runs webpack dev server)
* **yarn build** (creates dist folder with js and html file)
* **yarn test** (runs test, pending to be completed)

### This is a learning experiment ideas are welcome
